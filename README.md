# Package Delivery Marketplace

## What's this?
This project is made by two students at the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Cooperative State University, Germany. It's designed as a marketplace, where customers can insert packages, which need to be delivered. Similar to Uber's concept. any person with a vehicle can assign himself/herself as a driver and deliver packages of customers.
